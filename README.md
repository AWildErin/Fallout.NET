# Fallout.NET
.NET Standard 2.0 library to work with Fallout ESM files. TES games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim) may still work but they are not being tested.

This library contains substantial code from [demonixis/ESMSharp](https://github.com/demonixis/ESMSharp) and the license can be found under [ESMSharp.LICENSE.md](ESMSharp.LICENSE.md)
